## Introduction

`hello-world` is a remake of the repository that is also called [hello-world](https://github.com/leachim6/hello-world). My plan was to organize the repo a little bit neater. Though they take full credit of what I am about to make since they are the one that inspired me to do this at the first place, I just want to make a version 2 of that repo. If you own the original hello-world repo and want this to be taken down, please contact me in the organization email and I will be happy to comply.
